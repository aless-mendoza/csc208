# 4.2 Question 6

**Your summer job pays you $1000 per week, with a raise of $50 per week as a bonus for not being a quitter. How much will you make in the 10th week?**

- 1450

## Break down
- the first week we get paid $1000
    - $a_{1}$
- the second week get paid $1050
    - $a_{2}$

## What type of growth?
- This is an **arithmetic sequence** because it grows at a constant rate

$$ a_{n} = a_{1} + (n - 1)d $$

- The **common difference is $50** since that's the increase pay every week
- n = 10 since we are looking for the 10th term

$$ a_{10} = 1000 + (10 - 1)50 = 1450 $$
