# Chapter 3.3, question 6

**For how many $n$ $\in$ {1, 2, ..., 790} is $n$ a multiple of one or more of 8, 5, or 9?**
- 299

## Process:
<code style="color : fuchsia"> 1) Find how many multiples are for 5, 8, and 9 (Multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, ..., etc) </code>
- **Multiples of 5**: 790/5 = 158
- **Multiples of 8**: 790/8 = 98
- **Multiples of 9**: 790/9 = 87

<code style="color : fuchsia"> 2) Subtract least common multiples (overcounts) </code><br>
These are overcounts since LCMs are counted once under one number and then again with the other. We subtract the multiples of the LCM since those are all the numbers that are overcounted <br>
- **Multiples of 5 & 8 (LCM = 40)**: 790/40 = 19
- **Multiples of 5 & 9 (LCM = 45)**: 790/45 = 17
- **Multiples of 8 & 9 (LCM = 72)**: 790/72 = 10

<code style="color : fuchsia"> 3) Add back over-subtracted counts (LCMs of 5, 8, **and** 9) </code><br>
When subtracting the LCMs the first time, we inadvertenly subtract the LCMs of 5,8, and 9 twice <br>
- **Multiples of 5, 8 & 9 (LCM = 360)**: 790/360 = 2

<code style="color : fuchsia"> 4) Apply inclusion-exclusion </code> <br>
98 + 158 + 87 - 19 - 10 - 17 + 2 = 299
