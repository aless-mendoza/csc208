# 3.6 Additional Excerise 12

## 12. How many ways are there to rearrange the letters in the word “rearrange”? Answer this question in at least two different ways to establish a binomial identity.
---

## Direct Permutation Calculation
"rearrange" has 9 letters with repeats:
- "r" repeats 3 times
- "a" appeats 2 times
- "e" repeats 2 times
- "n" and "g" only appear once

$$ \frac{total letters}{repeated terms (eliminate recounts} = \frac{9!}{3! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{362880}{24} = 15120 $$

**DISCLAIMER -** technically the bottom is actually just the number each character shows up however 1! = 1 and anything multiplied by 1 equals itself

## Using the Binomial Coefficient Identity
Here we  will be building the word letter by letter to find the total rearrangements
- "r" repeats 3 times and can be placed anywhere within the 9 characters of the word "rearrange"

$$ \binom{9}{3} = 84 $$
- "a" repeats 2 times. Since "r" takes up 3 spaces, we're left with 6 spaces (9-3)

$$ \binom{6}{2} = 15 $$

- "e" repeats 2 times. Since "r" and "a" have taken 5 spaces, we're left with 4 spaces (9-5)


$$ \binom{4}{6} = 6 $$

- "n" and "g" appear 1 time. Since we are left with only 2 slots remaining after e is placed, there are only 2 possible positions for the letters remaining
    - If you did write it as a binomial, you would have the total positions over the repeats

$$ \binom{2}{1} = 2 $$

<br>
Finally, we're left with: 

$$ 84 \cdot 15 \cdot 6 \cdot 2 = 15120 $$

## Summary
- Both of these solutions are just different ways to get to the formula:

$$ \frac{9!}{3! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} $$

or

$$ \binom{9}{3} \cdot \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{6} \cdot \binom{2}{1} $$
