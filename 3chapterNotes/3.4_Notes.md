# Combinations and Permutations: Key Concepts

## 1. Understanding Counting Principles
- **Product Principle (Multiplication Rule):** If an outcome is created by **combining independent choices**, multiply the number of options for each choice.
- **Sum Principle (Addition Rule):** If an outcome can be chosen in **multiple mutually exclusive ways**, add the number of options for each choice.

**Example:**
- If a pizza parlor offers **8 toppings**, choosing **4 toppings** without worrying about the order involves the **combination formula**:

  $$\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!}$$

- If you also need to arrange those toppings in a specific order, use **permutations** instead.

## 2. Difference Between Permutations & Combinations

|  | **Permutation** | **Combination** |
|---|----------------|---------------|
| **Order matters?** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Formula** | $P(n, k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$ | $C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ |
| **Example** | Arranging **3 books** from a shelf of 7 | Choosing **3 books** to take home |

**Example Problems:**
- **Picking digits for a combination lock:** Use **permutations** since order matters.
- **Choosing a group of friends for dinner:** Use **combinations** since order doesn't matter.

## 3. Factorials & Their Role in Counting
- **Factorial ($n!$)** means multiplying all numbers from **1 to n**:

  $$5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$$

- **Zero factorial ($0!$) is defined as 1**:

  $$0! = 1$$

Factorials are used in both **permutations** and **combinations** to remove duplicates when arranging objects.

## 4. Combinations with Restrictions
Sometimes, we apply combinations but with specific rules:
- **Choosing books while keeping alphabetical order** → Still a combination, but filtered for increasing sequences.
- **Choosing pizzas with at least 1 topping** → Use multiple combinations (sum principle).

**Example:**
- A pizza shop allows **0 to 8 toppings**, meaning the total number of possible pizzas is:

  $$\sum_{k=0}^{8} \binom{8}{k} = 2^8 = 256$$

---

## 5. Counting Anagrams (Rearrangements of Letters)
- If all letters are unique, use **factorials**:

  $$\text{Total anagrams of "troublemakings"} = 15!$$

- If some letters **repeat**, divide by their factorials to remove duplicate arrangements:

  $$\frac{n!}{\text{Factorial of repeated letters}}$$

**Example:**
- **Word "voodoo" (6 letters, 4 repeated "o"s)**:

  $$\frac{6!}{4!} = \frac{720}{24} = 30$$

---

## 6. Lattice Paths & Grid Counting
When navigating a **grid**, the shortest path follows the **binomial coefficient**:
- **Gridtown example:** Moving **13 right, 13 up**:

  $$\binom{26}{13} = \frac{26!}{13!13!}$$

---

## 7. Functions & Arrangements
- **Injective (one-to-one) functions** → Each element must be mapped uniquely.
- **Increasing functions** → Must preserve relative order.

**Example:**
- Choosing **6 numbers** from {1, 2, 3, …, 7} so that they are **increasing**:

  $$\binom{7}{6} = 7$$

---

## 8. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
Used when calculating **overlapping sets**:

  $$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$$

For three sets:

  $$|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |B \cap C| - |A \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$$

**Example:**
- Counting students who take **Math, Physics, or both**, avoiding double counts.

## Summary of Key Formulas

### **Permutations (Ordered Selection)**
  $$P(n, k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$

### **Combinations (Unordered Selection)**
  $$C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

### **Grid Paths (Lattice Paths)**
  $$\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$

### **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**
  $$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$$
