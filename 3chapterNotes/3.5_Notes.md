# 3.5 Notes

## Definitions
- **permutation:** if each outcome in a set of outcomes we are counting can be represnted by a sequence (if the terms in the sequence don't repeat)
- **combination:** if we are counting outcome for which we don't distinguish between different arrangements of the term (order doesn't matter)
- **Multisets:** Structure for counting that permits elements in the set to sppear more than once
    - an unordered collection of elements, each can appear multiple times
- **Multiplicity:** The number of times an element appears

|Distinguished Arrangments -> | Yes | No |
|-----------------------------|-----|----|
| Repeats are ok              | Sequences, Product Principle, $n^k$| Multisets|
| No repeats                  | Sequences, Permutations, P(n, k) | Sets, Combinations, $\binom{n}{k}$|

## Representing Multisets
- **Numbers:** Shows the multiplicity of each item. For example if you have 7 cookies and four kids you can write **3112** where the first kid gets 3 cookies, the second gets  1, etc
- **letters:** Same purpose as above. You have 7 cookies and 4 kids which can be written as **A,A,A,B,C,D,D** where kid A gets three cookies (A,A,A), kid B gets one cookie (B) etc
- **Sequence of 1s:** 111,1,1,11 same concept as letters
- **Sticks and Stones:** its just a dots and lines version of ones and commas

## Stars and Bars theorem
- Used to count the number of ways to distribute identical objects among distinct groups

- You have n objects -> in this case cookies, ints and crayons
- You are distributing them among k distinct groups -> (kids, vars, and colors
- Some groups may recieve zero object :(

**Formula** 


$$ \binom{n+k-1}{k-1} $$
