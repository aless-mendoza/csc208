# 3.5 Question A2

**Solve the three counting problems below. Then say why it makes sense that they all have the same answer. That is, say how you can interpret them as each other.** 
- How many ways are there to distribute 8 cookies to 3 kids?
    - 45
- How many solutions in non-negative integers are there to $x$ + $y$ + $z$ = 8?
    - 45
- How many different packs of 8 crayons can you make using crayons that come in red, blue, and yellow?
    - 45
- Why are they the same?

## Stars and Bars theorem
- Used to count the number of ways to distribute identical objects among distinct groups

- You have n objects -> in this case cookies, ints and crayons
- You are distributing them among k distinct groups -> (kids, vars, and colors
- Some groups may recieve zero object :(

**Formula** <br>
$$ \binom{n+k-1}{k-1} $$

## Problem 1 - How many ways are there to distribute 8 cookies to 3 kids?
$$ \binom{n+k-1}{k-1} $$
- n = 8 cookies
- k = 3 kids
$$ \binom{8+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45 $$

## Problem 2 - How many solutions in non-negative integers are there to $x$ + $y$ + $z$ = 8?
$$ \binom{n+k-1}{k-1} $$
- n = sum of 8
- k = 3 variables
$$ \binom{8+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45 $$

## Problem 3 - How many different packs of 8 crayons can you make using crayons that come in red, blue, and yellow?
$$ \binom{n+k-1}{k-1} $$
- n = 8 crayons
- k = 3 colors
$$ \binom{8+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45 $$

## Why are they all the same? 
- Each problem had us distribute 8 objects across 3 distinct groups
    - When plugging in the variables to the Stars and Bars theorem, they were teh same
