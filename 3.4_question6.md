# 3.4 Question 6

How many anagrams are there of the word “voodoo” that start with the letter “v”?
- 5
---
## Process 1 - logic

### 1) count how many places "d" can be.
- Since V is in a set spot, you can just ignore it. Since there is only 1 letter that is different, by counting where it can go you know every possible answer
    - "vdoooo", "vodooo", "voodoo", "vooodo", "vooood"
    - 5

## Process 2 - math

### 1) Count
- Since V is in a set spot, we can ignore it. This leaves the last 5 letters to move around ("oodoo"). This gives us **5!**
- The "o"s repeat 4 times so we don't need to count them seperately. To fix this overcount, we'd divide $\frac{5!}{4!}$ = 5
