## Challenges

### Challenge I
Find a statement logically equivalent (i.e. having the same truth table) to p => q using or and ~ operators.

`ttg_cli.py "['p', 'q']" -p "['p => q']" -i False`

|  p  |  q  |  p => q  |
|-----|-----|----------|
|  1  |  1  |    1     |
|  1  |  0  |    0     |
|  0  |  1  |    1     |
|  0  |  0  |    1     |

`ttg_cli.py "['p', 'q']" -p "['~p or q']" -i False`

|  p  |  q  |  ~p or q  |
|-----|-----|-----------|
|  1  |  1  |     1     |
|  1  |  0  |     0     |
|  0  |  1  |     1     |
|  0  |  0  |     1     |

### Challenge II
Solve the riddle:

    Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.
    Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.
    Troll 3: Either we are all knaves, or at least one of us is a knight.

p: Troll 1 is a knave<br>
q: There are two knights<br>
r: Troll 1 is lying
s: They are knaves

`ttg_cli.py "['p', 'q', 'r', 's']" -p "['(p => q) and (s or ~s) and (~r) and (p) and (s)']" -i False`

|  p  |  q  |  r  |  s  |  (p => q) and (s or ~s) and (~r) and (p) and (s)  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|---------------------------------------------------|
