# 5.2 Notes

## Vocab
- **function:** a rule that assigns each input to one output
- **image:** the outputs of the inputs
- **domain:** all the inputs for a function
- **range:** the sets of natural numbers that are outputs
- **closed formulas:** an explicit formula that calculates the image of any element in the domain
- **injective (one-to-one):** one input to one output
- **surjective:** every input and output is used
- **bijective:** When a function is both injective and surjective
- **$f$(A) means image of A under $f$:** elements in Y that are the image of elements from A 
- **$f^{-1}$(A) means inverse image of A under $f$** elements in X whose image are elements in A
- **$f^{-1}$(y) meas complete inverse image of y under f:** not inverse unless bijective

## Exercises

### 1 Consider the function f : {1,2,3,4,5} -> {5,3,3,4,2}

a. Find f(5): 2
    - 5 is the input

b. Find a n in the domain such that f(n)=5: 1
    - domain is input

c. Find an element n of the domain such that f(n)=n: 3
    - where the in and out are the same

d. Find an element of the codomain that is not in the range: 1
    - codomain is outputs
---
### 2 the following functions all have {1,2,3,4,5} as domain and codomain. Determine is it is injective, surjective, bijective, or neither

a. neither
    - not all values of x are used or smth idrk
b. neither
    - not all values are used in codomain and multiple ins have the same outs
c. Bijective
    - all elements used and every in has a unique out
d. Bijective
    - all elements used and every in has a unique out
---
### 3 f : (1,2,3,4,5} -> {1,2,3} for the following. determine is it is injective, surjective, bijective, or neither

a. neither
    - not all values in codomain used and none unique outs
b. neither
    - not all values in codomain used and none unique outs
c. surjectve
    - all elements are used but non unique outs

<br>if the codomain is smaller than the domain, then it can never be injective

---
### 4 f : {1,2,3,4} -> {1,2,3,4,5}.  determine is it is injective, surjective, bijective, or neither

a. neither
    -  not all values in codomain used and none unique outs
b. injective
    - not all values in codomain used and unique outs
c. injective
    - not all values in codomain used and unique outs

<br> if the codomain is larger, then it can never be surjective

- $2^{4}$

a. 16
b. 14
    - all of the functions use every value except two where we have the codomains {a,a,a,a} and {b,b,b,b}
c. 0 
    - since the codomain is smaller
d. 0
    - since none are injective

16-

</pre>
$2^{4}$

a. 16
b. 0 
    - since the codomain is bigger
c. 12
    - everything is injective except the 4 codomains where {a,a} {b,b} {c,c} {d,d}
d. 0
    - since no surjective
---
### 7 given f : {1,2,3,4,5} -> {3,2,4,1,2}
a. is f injective: no since 2 is repeated in the out
<br>b. is f surjective: yes all elements are used

---
### 8 give f : {1,2,3,4} -> {3,4,1,3}
a. is f injective: no since there is a repeated out
<br>b. is f surjective: no, 2 is never used in the out

---
### 9 f : N -> N given recursively by f(0) = 1 and f(n+1) = 4 * f(n)
Find f(14): $4^{14}$
<br>f(0) = 1
<br>f(n+1) = 4 * f(n)
<br>f(0+1) = 4 * 1 = 4 = f(1)
<br>f(1+1) = 4 * 4 = 16 = f(2)
<br>f(2+1) = 4 * 16 = 64 = f(3)

- the pattern is f(n) = $4^n$
Thus
- f(14) = $4^14$
---
### 10 f : N -> N given recursively f(n+1) = f(n) + 8
- Note that this is not enough info to define the functino since the initial condition isn't given. **For the following find f(8)**

a. If f(0)=1
f(0+1) = 1 + 8 = f(1) = 9
f(1+1) = 9 + 8 = f(2) = 17
f(2+1) = 17 + 8 = f(3) = 25
- pattern
