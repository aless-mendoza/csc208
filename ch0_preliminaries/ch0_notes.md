## Vocabulary
* **Discrete (adj)** -> Individually separate and distinct.
* **Mathematics** -> Problem solving regarding numbers, lines, functions...
* **Discrete Structures** -> Mathematical objects that we use to represent parts of the problems we are solving
    * The structures we will use are: **sets**, **functions**, **sequences**, **relations**, and **graphs**

## Structures:

### Sets
* **Sets:** An unordered collection of elements
* **Set Comprehension (or Set Builder Notation):** $A$ = {x \$in$ $N$ : $x$ < 10} which reads as $A$ is the set of (=s) natural numbers ($N$) that satisfy the property that they are less than 10($x$ <10).
* We can build sets from ones we already have by using **Unions** or **Intersections**
* **Cardinality:** How many elements are in a set. Ex: $A$ = {1, 2, 3} The cardinality of $A$ is 3 because it has 3 elements

### Functions
* **Functions:** a rule that assigns each input exactly one output
* **Image:** output of an input
* **Domain:** The set of all inputs
* **Codomain:** The set of all allowable outputs
* **Range:** the set of all actual outputs aka the set of all images of elements form the domain
* $f$ : $X$ -> $Y$ where the funciton name is $f$, $X$ is the domain, and $Y$ is the codomain
* **Closed Formula:** each output is given by an explicit rule based solely on its input 
    * Ex. $f$($n$) = 3$n$ + 1 is a closed function since for every value of $n$ there is a defined output

### Sequences
* **Sequences:** ordered sets
* **Finite Sequences:** Ex. (1, 2, 3) is finite because there is a set amount of elements
* **Infinite Sequences:** Have an undefined amount of elements


### Relations
* 

### Graphs
*

## Questions

* What is discrete math?
    * {0, 1, 2} is discrete because the elements are seperate whereas in y=x^2 the outputs aren't seperate
    * Typically ints (whole numbers)


* What are the four main topics that Professor Levin says will be presented in the book?
    * We will be covering **combinatorics**, **sequences**, **symbolic logic**, and **graph theory**

* What are discrete structures? Which specific examples are listed in the chapter? Briefly describe each of these.
