    * {0, 1, 2} is discrete because the elements are seperate whereas in y=x^2 the outputs aren't seperate
    * Typically ints (whole numbers)


* What are the four main topics that Professor Levin says will be presented in the book?

* What are discrete structures? Which specific examples are listed in the chapter? Briefly describe each of these.
