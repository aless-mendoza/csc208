# Additional Excercise 3

## Consider the three sequences below. For each, find a recursive definition. How are these sequences related? 
- 2,4,6,10,16,26,42, ... 
- 5,6,11,17,28,45,73, .... 
- 0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ...

### 2,4,6,10,16,26,42, ...
- initial terms are $a_{1}$ = 2 and $a_{2}$ = 4
- Pattern (recurrence relation) is $a_{n-1}$ + $a_{n-2}$ = $a_{n}$
    - 2 + 4 = 6
    - 16 + 26 = 42

### 5,6,11,17,28,45,73, ....
- initial terms are $a_{1}$ = 5 and $a_{2}$ = 6
- Pattern is $a_{n-1}$ + $a_{n-2}$ = $a_{n}$
    - 5 + 6 = 11
    - 17 + 28 = 45

### 0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ...
- initial terms are $a_{1}$ = 0 and $a_{2}$ = 0
- Since its all 0 there is no acutally change in the sequence
- The pattern is $a_{n}$ = 0

### Conclusion
- sequence a and b have the same recurrence pattern but different starting values
- sequence c is constant
