# Additional Excercise 3

## Consider the three sequences below. For each, find a recursive definition. How are these sequences related? 
- 2,4,6,10,16,26,42, ... 
- 5,6,11,17,28,45,73, .... 
- 0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ...

### 2,4,6,10,16,26,42, ...
- It's an arithmatic sequence
- Pattern is $a_{n-1}$ + $a_{n-2}$ = $a_{n}$
    - 2 + 4 = 6
    - 16 + 26 = 42

### 5,6,11,17,28,45,73, ....
- It's an arithmatic sequence
- Pattern is $a_{n-1}$ + $a_{n-2}$ = $a_{n}$
    - 5 + 6 = 11
    - 17 + 28 = 45

### 0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ...
- Since its all 0 there is no acutally change in the sequence
- Technically you can say the pattern is $a_{n-1}$ + $a_{n-2}$ = $a_{n}$
    - 0 + 0 = 0

### Conclusion
- sequence a and b are both arithmatic sequences with the same pattern
- sequence c is constant
