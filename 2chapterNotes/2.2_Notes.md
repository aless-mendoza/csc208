# 2.2 Notes

## Definitions
- **tree**: a connected graph containing no cycles
- **forest**: a graph containing no cycles. (a connected forest is a tree)
- **rooted trees**: we designate one vertex as the root - beginning
- **spanning tree**: a tree that includes all the vertices of a connected graph
    - a subgraph that still includes all the vertices
- **leaves**: vertices of degree one
- **induction**: A proof technique that's useful to compare a given tree to a smaller tree
- **Parent** if you have two vertices, the one closer to the root is the parent and the other is the **child**

## Corollarys
- **2.2.3**: A graph F is a forest if and only if between any pair of vertices in F there is at most one path.

## Propositions
- **2.2.2**: A graph T is a tree if and only if between every pair of distinct vertices of T there is a unique path.
- **2.2.4**: Any tree with at least two vertices has at least two vertices of degree one.
- **2.2.5**: Let T be a tree with v vertices and e edges. Then e = v - 1.

## Theorems
- **2.2.7**: Every connected graph has a spanning tree.
