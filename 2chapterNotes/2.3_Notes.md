# 2.3 Notes

## Definitions
- **planar**: when you draw a graph and **it's possible** so make it so the edges don't cross
    - **planar representation**: Is when the graph is drawn in the planar form
- **face**: the regions created by the edges of the graph (the outside is also a face)
- **$K_5$**: smallest none planar graph (5 vertices in a complete graph)
- **f =< B**: Each face needs edges and B is the total number of boundaries around all the faces in a graph
- **Polyhedra**: A geometric solid made up of flate polygonal faces joined at edges and vertices
- **Convex Polyhedra**: any line segment connecting two points on the interior of the polyhedron must be entirely contained inside the polyhedra

## Theorems
- **2.3.1** - $K_5$ is not planar
- **2.3.2** - $K_3,3$ is not planar
- **2.3.4** - There are exactly five regular polyhedra

## Euler's Formula for Planar Graphs
- vertices - edges + faces = 2
    - v-e+f=2
