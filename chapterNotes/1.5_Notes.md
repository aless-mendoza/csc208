# 1.5 Notes

## Notes

### Proofs about Sets
- Sets are unordered
- They can be written as:
    - $A$ = {1,2,3,4,5}
    - $B$ = {x $\in$ $N$ : x < 6}
- $\cup$ is union

#### Subset
- A set is a **subset** of set B which can be written as $A$ $\subseteq$ $B$
    - $A$ = {1,2,3} $\subseteq$ $B$ = {1,2,3,4,5}
- A is a **proper subset** of $B$ written as $A$ $\subset$ $B$ when A != B

#### Proposition 1.5.3
- For any sets $A$, $B$, and $C$, if $A$ $\subseteq$ $B$ and $B$ $\subseteq$ $C$, than $A$ $\subseteq$ $C$

### Proofs about Functions
- $f$ : $A$ -> $B$ is injective (or one-to-one); Every output of B has one input from A
    - $B$ is the codomain
- $f$ : {1,2,3} -> {a,b,c}
    - $f$(1) = a. $f$(2) = b, $f$(3) = c
    - the second set can't have any repeat values

#### Proposition 1.5.7
- $f$ : $A$ -> $B$ is a function with $A$ and $B$ both finite sets. If |$A$| > |$B$|, then $f$ is **not** injective.

### Proofs about Relations
- A relation on a set $A$ is a set of ordered pairs of elements from $A$.
