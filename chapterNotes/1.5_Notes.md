# 1.5 Notes

## Notes

- Direct proofs are the simplest
    - You just assume the statement is true and logically follow steps to prove it
- Proof by Contradiction is assuming the opposite of what you want to prove
    - Show the assumption leads to contradiction
- proof by contrapositive
    - instead of "if P then Q", prove "if ~Q then ~P"
    - swap the two terms and negate them
- Element chasing proof is when you follow an element from one set to another
    - You can use this if you're proving subsets of equivalency

### Proofs about Sets
- Sets are unordered
- They can be written as:
    - $A$ = {1,2,3,4,5}
    - $B$ = {x $\in$ $N$ : x < 6}
- $\cup$ is union and means that A $\cup$ B contains all elements in A or B (both)
- \$cap\$ is intersection and means that A \$cap\$ B only contains elements that are in A AND B

#### Subset
- A set is a **subset** of set B which can be written as $A$ $\subseteq$ $B$
    - $A$ = {1,2,3} $\subseteq$ $B$ = {1,2,3,4,5}
- A is a **proper subset** of $B$ written as $A$ $\subset$ $B$ when A != B

#### Proposition 1.5.3
- For any sets $A$, $B$, and $C$, if $A$ $\subseteq$ $B$ and $B$ $\subseteq$ $C$, than $A$ $\subseteq$ $C$

### Proofs about Functions
- $f$ : $A$ -> $B$ is injective (or one-to-one); Every output of B has one input from A
    - $B$ is the codomain

- $f$ : {1,2,3} -> {a,b,c}
    - $f$(1) = a. $f$(2) = b, $f$(3) = c
    - the second set can't have any repeat values

#### Proposition 1.5.7
- $f$ : $A$ -> $B$ is a function with $A$ and $B$ both finite sets. If |$A$| > |$B$|, then $f$ is **not** injective.

#### Injectve (one-to-one)
|         $f$ : A -> B          |
|-------------------------------|
|A = {1,2,3,4}   B = {a,b,c,d,e}|
|A(Domain)         B(Codomain)  |
| 1 -----> a                    |
| 2 -----> b                    |
| 3 -----> c                    |
| 4 -----> d                    |
- No two arrows point at the same letter
- Every input has one output

#### Surjective (Onto)
|          $f$ : A -> B           |
|---------------------------------|
|A = {1,2,3,4,5}   B = {a,b,c,d,e}|
|A(Domain)         B(Codomain)    |
| 1 -----> a                      |
| 2 -----> b                      |
| 3 -----> c                      |
| 4 -----> d                      |
| 5 -----> e                      |
- Every element of B has **at least** one arrow pointing to it
- Every output has an input

#### Image and Preimage
|         $f$ : A -> B          |
|-------------------------------|
|A = {1,2,3,4}   B = {a,b,c,d,e}|
|A(Domain)       B(Codomain)    |
| 1 -----> a                    |
| 2 -----> b                    |
| 3 -----> c                    |
| 4 -----> d                    |
- **image**: If we take S = {1,2} then: f(S) = {a,b}
    - Image is the set of outputs corresponding to S
    - Like a section of the overall function
- **Preimage**: If T = {a,c} then: $f^-1$(T) = {1,3}
    - Inverse of image

### Proofs about Relations
- A relation on a set $A$ is a set of ordered pairs of elements from $A$.
- **Reflexive**: Every element is related to itself
- **symetric**: if a is related to b, then b is related to a
- **transitive**: If a is related to b and b to c, then a is related to b
    - like the 1.5.3 proposition

### Proofs about Graphs
- Graphs consist of **Verices (nodes)** and **edges (connections between nodes)**
- **degree of vertices** means how many edges connect to a vertex

#### Handshake Lemma states
- the sum of all vertex degrees is twice the number of all edges
- the product of any odd number times and even number is even
    - this means that the num of vertices with odd degrees must be even
