# 3.1 Notes

## Definitions
- **figurate numbers**: numbers that can be arranged in a geometric shape
- **pascal's triangle**: every number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it
    - **notation**: rows are counted down starting from 0 & columns are counted from the left also starting at 0. (row/column) (0/0) is the very top & (1/0) (1/1 is the second row
        - (n/k) said as n choose k

## Lattice Paths
- **integer lattice**: set of all points in the cartesian plane for which both the x and y coordinates are ints
- **lattice path**: one of the shortest possible paths connecting two points on the lattice
    - could be written with a combination of x and ys to represent which direction towards the point you go
- **length**: defined by the amount of steps or lines between points

## Bit Strings
- **bit string**: string of binary digits; 0s and 1s
- **length**: number of bits in string
- **weight**: amonut of 1s
- **n-bit string**" string of length n
- **$B^{n}_{k}$**: the set of all n-bit strings of weight k

## Subsets and Pizzas
- **subset**: set A is any set all of whose elements are also in A

## Algebra?
- **Binomial Theorem**: The nth row of Pascal's triangle gives the coefficients of the expansion of (x+y $)^n$. That is, for any positive integer n, (x+y$)^n$ = $(^{n}_{0}$)$x^n$ + $(^{n}_{1}$)$x^{n-1}$y+...+$(^{n}_{n-1}$)x$y^{n-1}$+$(^{n}_{n}$)$y^{n}$ so the coefficient of $x^k$$y^{n-k} is $(^{n}_{k}$)
