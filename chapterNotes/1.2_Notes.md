# Section 1.2 Notes on Implication

## Summary
- An **implication** is when P is true Q has to be true for the statement to be true, otherwise it is false. When P is false, Q can be anything, and the statement is true. This is because an implication just requires that when P is true Q is true.
- Implications allow us to make general claims
- The inverse is basically the contrapositive of the converse.
- When considering statements with quantifiers, we ignore the outside quantifiers when formating the converse, contrapositive, and inverse.
- Implications that are true may have false converses
- contrapositive of a true statement is always true
- When the implication and converse are true we say that P and Q are equivalent. 

## Vocab
- **Implication**: It is a molecular statement of the form $P \rightarrow Q$
- **Conditional**: Also known as an Implication $P \rightarrow Q$
- **Converse**: Regarding a certain implication, it is the opposite. Using the above defined implication it would be $Q \rightarrow P$.
- **Contrapositive**: Regarding a certain implication, it is the opposite and the negation. Using the above defined implication it would be $\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$
- **Inverse**: Regarding a certain implication, it takes the negation . Using the above defined implication it would be  $\neg P \rightarrow \neg Q$
