# 1.4 Notes

## Notes

### Direct Proof
- Can generally proven through explanations that carefully look at definitions

### Proof by Contrapositive
- An implication $P$ -> $Q$ is logically equiv. to its contrapositive $\lnot$ $Q$ -> $\lnot$ $P$
- Assume $\lnot$ $Q$. explain... therefore $\lnot$ $P$.

### Proof by Contradiction
- start with a single assumption and create a proof that leads to a false conclusion
- Assume $\lnot$ $P$. This means thatt... which tells us... so we can say... But that is a contradiction so $P$ must be true.
- $\lnot$ $P$ -> contradiction
