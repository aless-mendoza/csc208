## Notes

### Direct Proof
- Can generally proven through explanations that carefully look at definitions

### Proof by Contrapositive
- An implication $P$ -> $Q$ is logically equiv. to its contrapositive $\lnot$ $Q$ -> $\lnot$ $P$
- Assume $\lnot$ $Q$. explain... therefore $\lnot$ $P$.

### Proof by Contradiction
- start with a single assumption and create a proof that leads to a false conclusion
- Assume $\lnot$ $P$. This means thatt... which tells us... so we can say... But that is a contradiction so $P$ must be true.
- $\lnot$ $P$ -> contradiction

## Practice Problems

### 1)
- solve with direct proof

### 2)
- solve with proof of contrapositive

### 3)
- solve with proof by contrapositive

### 4)
- solve with contradiction

### 5)
- Contrapostive

- Contradiction

### 6) 
- Direct proof
    - f: A -> B is a bijection
- Proof by contrapositive
    - |A| != |B|
- Proof by contradiction
    - f: A -> B is a bijection and |A| != |B|
