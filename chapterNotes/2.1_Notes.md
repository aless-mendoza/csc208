# 2.1 Notes

## Definition
- A **graph** is and ordered pair G = (V,E) consisting of a nonempty set V (vertices) and a set E (edges) of two-element subsets of V
    - with this definition a a graph could be written as ({a,b,c,d},{ {a,b},{b,c},{b,d,},{c,d} })
    - The vertices are a,b,c,and d and the pairings are the line connections <br>
a--b <br>
|  /| <br>
|/  | <br>
c--d

- **Isomorphic** are graphs that are basically the same but have different vertice names
    - $G_1$ = ({a,b,c},{ {a,b},{b,c} }) $G_2$ = ({a,b,c}, { {a,c},{c,b} })
    - $G_1$ -> a---b---c
    - $G_2$ -> a---c---b
    
    - An **isomorphism** between two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ is a bijection f : $V_1$ - $V_2$ between the vertices of the graphs such that {a,b} is an edge in $G_1$ if and only if {f(a), f(b)} is an edge in $G_2$
    - Two graphs are **isomorphic** if there is an isomorphism between them. In this case, we write $G_1$ $\cong$ $G_2$

- **Subgraphs** is a smaller part of a large graph BUT THERE ARE TWO MAIN WAYS OF DEFINING IT
    - **ordinary subgraph** results from deleting some vertices and edges
        - We say that $G^2$ = ($V^'$, $E^'$) is a **subgraph** of G = (V, E), and` white $G^'$ $\subset$ G, provided $V^'$ $\subset$ V and $E^'$ $\subset$ E
    - **induced subgraph** results from deleting vertices and every edge attached to them
        - We say that $G^'$ = ($V^'$, $E^'$) is an **induced subgraph** of G = (V, E) provided $V^'$ $\subset$ V and every edge in E whose vertices are still in $V^'$ is also and edge in $E^'$
