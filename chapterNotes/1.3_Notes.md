# 1.3 Notes

## Example Problems
### 1.3.2
Make a truth table for the statement ~P $\lor$ Q
|  p  |  q  |  ~p or q  |
|-----|-----|-----------|
|  1  |  1  |     1     |
|  1  |  0  |     0     |
|  0  |  1  |     1     |
|  0  |  0  |     1     |

### 1.3.3
Analyze the statement, “If you get more doubles than any other player, then you will lose, or if you lose, then you must have bought the most properties,” using truth tables.

IF (double -> lose) V (lose -> properties)
(d => l) $\lor$ (l => p)

|  d  |  l  |  p  |  d => l  |  l => p  |  (d => l) or (l => p)  |
|-----|-----|-----|----------|----------|------------------------|
|  1  |  1  |  1  |    1     |    1     |           1            |
|  1  |  1  |  0  |    1     |    0     |           1            |
|  1  |  0  |  1  |    0     |    1     |           1            |
|  1  |  0  |  0  |    0     |    1     |           1            |
|  0  |  1  |  1  |    1     |    1     |           1            |
|  0  |  1  |  0  |    1     |    0     |           1            |
|  0  |  0  |  1  |    1     |    1     |           1            |
|  0  |  0  |  0  |    1     |    1     |           1            |

### 1.3.6
Are the statements, “It will not rain or snow,” and, “It will not rain and it will not snow,” logically equivalent?

~(r $\lor$ s) <br>
~r $\land$ ~s

|  r  |  s  |  ~(r or s)  |  ~r and ~s  |
|-----|-----|-------------|-------------|
|  1  |  1  |      0      |      0      |
|  1  |  0  |      0      |      0      |
|  0  |  1  |      0      |      0      |
|  0  |  0  |      1      |      1      |

Yes, they're the same

### 1.3.8
Prove that the statements ~(P => Q) and P $\land$ ~Q are logically equivalent without using truth tables.

The not around (P => Q) means that the statement will always output false since both statements would be false regardless of the implication. Since the second statement has a ~Q and uses an AND comparitor, the statement will always be false since true AND false outputs false.

### 1.3.10
Are the statements (P $\lor$ Q) => R and (P => R) $\land$ (Q => R) logically equivalent?

|  p  |  q  |  r  |  (p or q) => r  |  (p => r) or (q => r)  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----------------|------------------------|
|  1  |  1  |  1  |        1        |           1            |
|  1  |  1  |  0  |        0        |           0            |
|  1  |  0  |  1  |        1        |           1            |
|  1  |  0  |  0  |        0        |           1            |
|  0  |  1  |  1  |        1        |           1            |
|  0  |  1  |  0  |        0        |           1            |
|  0  |  0  |  1  |        1        |           1            |
|  0  |  0  |  0  |        1        |           1            |

NO - the fourth lines don't match

### 1.3.14
Show that the following is a valid deduction rule.<br>
 p => q<br>
~p => q<br>
\--------<br>
$\therefore$ q

|  p  |  q  |  p => q  |  ~p => q  |  (p => q) and (~p => q)  |
|-----|-----|----------|-----------|--------------------------|
|  1  |  1  |    1     |     1     |            1             |
|  1  |  0  |    0     |     1     |            0             |
|  0  |  1  |    1     |     1     |            1             |
|  0  |  0  |    1     |     0     |            0             |

q is true in the same rows that (p => q) and (~p => q) are true therefore it's a valid deduction.

### 1.3.15
Decide whether the following is a valid deduction rule. <br>
p => r <br>
q => r <br>
  r <br>
\----<br>

$\therefore$ p $\lor$ q

|  p  |  q  |  r  |  p => r  |  q => r  |  p or q  |  (p => r) and (q => r) and r  |
|-----|-----|-----|----------|----------|----------|-------------------------------|
|  1  |  1  |  1  |    1     |    1     |    1     |               1               |
|  1  |  1  |  0  |    0     |    0     |    1     |               0               |
|  1  |  0  |  1  |    1     |    1     |    1     |               1               |
|  1  |  0  |  0  |    0     |    1     |    1     |               0               |
|  0  |  1  |  1  |    1     |    1     |    1     |               1               |
|  0  |  1  |  0  |    1     |    0     |    1     |               0               |
|  0  |  0  |  1  |    1     |    1     |    0     |               1               |
|  0  |  0  |  0  |    1     |    1     |    0     |               0               |

This isn't valid since when the last statement is true, p or q is false so it is wrong.
