# 2.4 Notes

## Definitions
- **Walk**: a sequence of vertices such that every vertec in the sequence is adjacent to the vertives before and after in the sequence
- **Euler Trail**: If the walk travels along every edge exactly once (one of those tracing games where you can't repeat a line
    - **Euler Circuit**: If the starting and ending vertex are the same
- **Hamilton Path**: If there is a path that visits every vertex exactly once
    - There isn't a set way to test if the graph has a Hamilton Path. Generally there will be more edges than vertices and is relatively easy to find in small graphs, however as the size increases, it is harder to determine.

## Conditions for Euler Trails
- If the graph **DOESN'T** have and <ins>euler circuit</ins>, it will have a vertec with the degree of 1 (a spike)
- If you're starting on a vertex with an odd degree, you **WON'T** have a <ins>euler circuit</ins>
- Iff all the vertices of a graph have an even degree, then the graph **HAS** an <ins>euler circuit</ins>
- A graph **HAS** an <ins>Euler trail</ins> iff there are at most two vertices with odd degrees
