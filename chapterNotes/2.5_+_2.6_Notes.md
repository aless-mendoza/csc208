# 2.5 Notes

## Definitions
- **vertex coloring**: when you color the vertices
- **proper**: if the adjacent vertices are colored differently
- **chromatic number**: the smallest number of colored needed to get a proper <ins>vertex</ins> coloring
- **clique**: a set of vertices all of which are pairwise adjacent
- **clique number**: the largest n for which the graph contains a clique of size n
- **perfect**: graphs when the chromatic number is = to the clique number
- **chromatic index**: The  least number required to properly color the <ins>edges</ins> of a graph; written as $\chi$'(G)

## Theorems
- **The Four Color Theorem**: If G is a planar graph, then the chromatic number of G is less than or equal to 4. Thus any map can be properly colored with 4 or fewer colors.
- **2.5.4**: The chromatic number of a graph G is at least the clique number of G.
- **Brook's Theorem**: Any graph D satisfies $\chi$(G) <= $\Delta$(G), unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle, in which case $\chi$(G) = $\Delta$(G)+1
- **Vizing's Theorem**: For any graph G, the chromatix index $\chi$'(G) is either $\Delta$(G) or $\Delta$(G) + 1

## Chromatic Numbers
- $K_n$ (complete graph) chromatic number = n
- $K_(n,m)$ (bipartite complete graph) chromatic number = 2 for all m, n >=1
- $C_n$ (just one big loop) chromatic number is 2 if n is even and 3 if n is odd
- $P_n$ (just one long path) chromatic number = 2

## Chromatic Indexes
- For edge coloring, determine if $\chi$'(G) = $\Delta$(G) or $\chi$'(G) = $\Delta$(G) + 1, based on edge adjacency 
- $P_n$ = 2

# 2.6 Notes

## Definitions
- **Relation**: the generalization of a graph
- **modulus**: the remainder in a division problem
- **Cartesian Product**: denoted as A X B is the set of all ordered pairs (a,b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.
    - A X B = {(a,b) | a $\in$ A, b $\in$ B 
- **binary relation**: a set of ordered pairs
- **2.6.2**: We say the binary relation is a **relation on sets A and B** provided the ordered pairs are a subset of A x B. We say a binary relation is a **relation on a set A** provided the ordered pairs are a subset of A x A
- **2.6.5**: Given a binary relation R, define $R^-1$ to be the **inverse** of R as the set
    - $R^-1$ = {(b,a) : (a,b) $\in$ R}
- **2.6.6**: Let R be a relation from set A to B and S be a relation from B to C. The **composition** of R and S is
    - S o R = {(a,c) $\in$ A x C: (a,b) $\in$ R and (b,c) $\in$ S for some b $\in$ B}
- **equivalence relation**: a relation that is reflecive, symmetric, and transitive
- **2.6.20**: Given a non-empty set A, a partition of A is a set P of non-empty subsets of A such that every element of A is in exactly one element of P.

## Properties of Relations
Let R be a relation on the set A
- R is **reflexive** provided (a,a) $\in$ A for all a $\in$ A
- R is **symmetric** provided, for all a, b $\in$ A, is (a,b) $\in$ R then (b,a) $\in$ R
- R is **transitive** provided, for all a,b,c $\in$ A, if (a,b) $\in$ R and (b,c) $\in$ R, then (a,c) $\in$ R
 
## Theorem 2.6.23
Given any equivalence relation R on a set ,R the equivalence classes form a partition of A. 
Given any partition P = {$B_1$,$B_2$,...,} of a set A, the relation $\equiv$ p defined by a $\equiv$ p b if and only if a and b belong to the same block of P, is an equivalence relation.
Further, the equivalence classes for the equivalence relation formed by a partition are exactly the original partition, and the equivalence relation built by the partition of its equivalence classes is exactly the original equivalence relation.
