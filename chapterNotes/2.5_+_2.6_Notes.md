# 2.5 Notes

## Definitions
- **vertex coloring**: when you color the vertices
- **proper**: if the adjacent vertices are colored differently
- **chromatic number**: the smallest number of colored needed to get a proper <ins>vertex</ins> coloring
- **clique**: a set of vertices all of which are pairwise adjacent
- **clique number**: the largest n for which the graph contains a clique of size n
- **perfect**: graphs when the chromatic number is = to the clique number
- **chromatic index**: The  least number required to properly color the <ins>edges</ins> of a graph; written as $\chi$'(G)

## Theorems
- **The Four Color Theorem**: If G is a planar graph, then the chromatic number of G is less than or equal to 4. Thus any map can be properly colored with 4 or fewer colors.
- **2.5.4**: The chromatic number of a graph G is at least the clique number of G.
- **Brook's Theorem**: Any graph D satisfies $\chi$(G) <= $\Delta$(G), unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle, in which case $\chi$(G) = $\Delta$(G)+1
- **Vizing's Theorem**: For any graph G, the chromatix index $\chi$'(G) is either $\Delta$(G) or $\Delta$(G) + 1

## Chromatic Numbers
- $K_n$ (complete graph) chromatic number = n
- $C_n$ (just one big loop) chromatic number is 2 is n is even and 3 if n is odd

## Chromatic Indexes
- For edge coloring, determine if $\chi$'(G) = $\Delta$(G) or $\chi$'(G) = $\Delta$(G) + 1, based on edge adjacency
